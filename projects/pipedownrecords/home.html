                When people hear of <span class="bold">Pipe Down Records</span> for the first time, they often ask
                "What kind of CDs do you release?" Quite simply, we specialize in offbeat
                and unique projects, whether they be singer/songwriter albums, releases from
                our ethnic and instrumental series, or spoken word projects. The musical
                styles are as varied as can be (from folk to rock to blues to classical to
                world, and on and on) -- but each project has that certain uniqueness that
                separates it from the run-of-the-mill, middle-of-the-pack releases in its genre.

                    The music business these days is tough -- getting CDs stocked at retail
                    outlets is difficult...radio is tightly formatted...and the major labels
                    are throwing more money after new releases than ever. All the more reason
                    for independent-minded music buyers to take an active role in seeking out
                    what's different and unique.

                    To our steady customers, we thank you for
                    going to great lengths to support our releases. To our new friends, check
                    out the various artists and see if you aren't the least bit intrigued by
                    some of the artists who you hadn't yet heard before. And maybe go one
                    step further and purchase one of their CDs. <span class="italic">I promise you</span>, you won't be sorry.
